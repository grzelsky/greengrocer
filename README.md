Greengrocer application

##

The application is based on the react library.
React redux was used to manage the state of the application.
The application presents a greengrocer, products are divided into three categories: fruits, vegetables and dried fruits. Each product in a given category can be added to the basket and removed from it.

##

When designing the application, I wanted to show the basic skills in using the following libraries: react, react-redux, react router. I used the styled-components library to style the look.
The application is also available for viewing at: grzelsky.github.io/greengrocer/.
If you want to try the application locally, run JSON server (npm run start: db) locally and run the application (npm start).
